## Background
Wanted an open source way to have family members (or anyone) ask questions of others and to record those answers in some way. Family stories are lost too often and we wanted a way to capture memories and life stories before it was too late, and to give those loved ones a way to pass on gifts of conversation and thought to future generations.

## Ideas
- [ ] Speech to text in browser
- [ ] Video or audio recording
- [ ] Custom questions
- [ ] (For lack of a better term) "Dead Man's Switch" to release certain answers
- [ ] Test
